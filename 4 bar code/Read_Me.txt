MEC 510 Final Project

Optimal Synthesis of Mechanisms Using Fourier Descriptors and Global Search Methods
Benjamin Brandwin

Task:
Develop a user interactive program which accepts the points of a curve and uses the Fourier
descriptors of the curve to optimize the design of a four bar mechanism. 

I was unfortunately unable to get the Fourier descriptors to work. I also did not have the time
to write a search algorithm for optimization. At the moment the program can only accept inputs of the 
four bar parameters via spin boxes on the right. A spin box at the top adjusts the speed and a radio button 
switches between the open and closed configurations.

All of the classes except for FFT and Complex were written by me. The Link class contains private data members
for position on screen, length and angle relative to the x axis. It contains all of the necessary functions
to draw a link on screen and return the end points. The coupler class is a subclasss of the Link class and contains 
the additional data members to define the coupler, which is drawn on screen as a GL_TRIANGLE. The PlanarFourBar
class accepts 3 Link and 1 coupler object, and uses the analytical formulas for position analysis to handle
the positioning of the mechanism components based on the crank angle. The PlanarFourBar class also contains a private 
data member to hold the points of the curve generated by the coupler point. 

Instructions:
use the spin box to adjust the speed of the animation, and mechanism parameters.
